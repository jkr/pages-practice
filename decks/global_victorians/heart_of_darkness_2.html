            <p>Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary
              day. The mind receives a myriad impressions—trivial,
              fantastic, evanescent, or engraved with the sharpness of
              steel. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of
              innumerable atoms; … [if a writer] could base his work
              upon his own feeling and not upon convention, there
              would be no plot, no comedy, no tragedy, no love
              interest or catastrophe in the accepted style … Life is
              not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life
              is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope
              surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to
              the end.  (Woolf “Modern Fiction”)</p>

              stick out of that river, when I saw my poleman give up

              deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole
              in. He kept hold on it though, and it trailed in the
              water. At the same time the fireman, whom I could also
              see below me, sat down abruptly before his furnace and
              ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at the

                <p> Africa as setting and backdrop which eliminates
                  the African as human factor. Africa as metaphysical
                  battlefield devoid of all recognizable humanity,
                  into which the wandering European enters at his
                  peril. Can nobody see the preposterous and perverse
                  arrogance in thus reducing Africa to the role props
                  for the breakup of one petty European
                  mind?<br/>(Chinua Achebe, "An Image of Africa")
