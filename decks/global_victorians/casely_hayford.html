            <p>I have taught you from your infancy to regard truth as the highest of
              all virtues, as the apex of character; and he who falls in declaring the
              truth in his day and generation, is but a humble follower of a Socrates,
              or if you prefer it, of the Nazarene. I try to follow his example,
              prepared to suffer if needs be in the cause of country, race, and
              humanity (Ch. 10)</p>

              to me the question I put to you a while ago, and you lay upon me the
              burden of solving my own riddle. (ch. 1)</p>

              into his face, he said: “It is a pity, Kwamankra, I did not meet you a

            <p>By the year 1925 a mighty change had come over the thought of the
              nations, and it was due to some extent to the work of the <em>Gold Coast
                Nation</em> <em>and Ethiopian Review</em>, promoted by Kwamankra just
              before the close of the first ten years of the century in the interests
              of Gold Coast national conservancy; but as time went on it had broadened
              out in sympathy to embrace the needs of the entire

              During the
              preceding fifteen years the <em>Nation</em> had freely circulated
              throughout the Ethiopian world, and the promoter and the Editors were in
              constant communication with the leading thinkers of the race throughout
              the world. (Ch. 20)</p>

            <p>Moreover, it had gradually dawned upon workers and thinkers alike
              that the way of material argument—the argument of bomb and shell—was not
              the Ethiopian’s way, and, in the world of progressive thought, the lamb
              was, after all, as the seer had foretold, leading the wolf and the lion
              instincts of the nations into right channels. It was a moral force with
              a moral persuasiveness which, like the wind, blowing whence men know
              not, yet was moulding the spiritual atmosphere of the world. (Ch.
