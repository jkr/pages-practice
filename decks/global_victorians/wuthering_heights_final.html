	    <p>I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I
	      went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit
	      to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall
	      go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself
	      compared with him. (Ch. 1)</p>

	    <p>“Ah, your favourites are among these?” I continued, turning to an
	      obscure cushion full of something like cats.</p>
	    <p>“A strange choice of favourites!” she observed scornfully.</p>
	    <p>Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. (Ch. 2)</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Then it flashed upon me—“The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his
	      tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her
	      husband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being
	      buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer
	      ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity—I must beware how
	      I cause her to regret her choice.” The last reflection may seem
	      conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive;
	      I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive. (Ch. 2)</p>

	    <p>He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a
	      gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather
	      slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he
	      has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose. Possibly, some
	      people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a
	      sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I
	      know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy
	      displays of feeling—to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He’ll love
	      and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to
	      be loved or hated again. (Ch. 1)</p>

	      he’s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine
	      are the same; and Linton’s is as different as a moonbeam from lightning,

	    <p>Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff’s presence.
	      Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise
	      from the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he heard
	      Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to
	      hear no further. (Ch. 9)</p>

	      dreadful to watch Catherine go. And Edgar standing solemnly by to see it
	      over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to his
	      house, and going back to his <em>books</em>! What in the name of all
	      that feels has he to do with <em>books</em>, when I am dying?” (Ch.

	    <p>My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change
	      it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff
	      resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight,
	      but necessary. Nelly, I <em>am</em> Heathcliff! He’s always, always in
	      my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to
	      myself, but as my own being. (Ch. 9)</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>“…now continue the history of Mr. Heathcliff, from where you left
	      off, to the present day. Did he finish his education on the Continent,
	      and come back a gentleman? or did he get a sizar’s place at college, or
	      escape to America, and earn honours by drawing blood from his
	      foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on the English
	      highways?”</p>
	    <p>“He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but
	      I couldn’t give my word for any. I stated before that I didn’t know how
	      he gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise
	      his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk…” (Ch. 10)</p>
