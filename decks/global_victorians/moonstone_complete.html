    <p>The Indian plot, Mr. Bruff, can only be a mystery to you, because you
      have never seriously examined it. Shall we run it over together, from
      the time when you drew Colonel Herncastle’s Will, to the time when the
      Indian called at your office? In your position, it may be of very
      serious importance to the interests of Miss Verinder, that you should be
      able to take a clear view of this matter in case of need. Tell me,
      bearing that in mind, whether you will penetrate the Indian’s motive for
      yourself? or whether you wish me to save you the trouble of making any
      inquiry into it?</p>

    <p>Arguing in this way, from within-outwards, what do we reach? We reach
      the Subjective view. I defy you to controvert the Subjective view. Very

      explanation follows, of course! Rachel, properly speaking, is not

    <p>It is all confusion to begin with; but it may be all brought into
      order and shape, if you can only find the right way. Acting on this
      plan, I filled in each blank space on the paper, with what the words or
      phrases on either side of it suggested to me as the speaker’s meaning;
      altering over and over again, until my additions followed naturally on
      the spoken words which came before them, and fitted naturally into the
      spoken words which came after them.</p>

      of us, that I am not asking you to try this experiment in deference to
      any theory of my own devising. Admitted principles, and recognised
      authorities, justify me in the view that I take. Give me five minutes of
      your attention; and I will undertake to show you that Science sanctions
      my proposal, fanciful as it may seem. Here, in the first place, is the

    <p>He handed me the slip of paper which had marked the place in the

    <p>“There seems much ground for the belief, that every sensory
      impression which has once been recognised by the perceptive
      consciousness, is registered (so to speak) in the brain, and may be
      reproduced at some subsequent time, although there may be no
      consciousness of its existence in the mind during the whole intermediate
      period.” “Is that plain, so far?” asked Ezra Jennings.</p>

    <p>“Dr. Abel informed me,” says Mr. Combe [presumably George Combe], “of
      an Irish porter to a warehouse, who forgot, when sober, what he had done
      when drunk: but, being drunk, again recollected the transactions of his
      former state of intoxication. On one occasion, being drunk, he had lost
      a parcel of some value, and in his sober moments could give no account
      of it. Next time he was intoxicated, he recollected that he had left the
      parcel at a certain house, and there being no address on it, it had
      remained there safely, and was got on his calling for it.” This man must
      have had two souls, one for his sober state, and one for him when drunk.

      through the miserable wretches, or cut them up, without a pang of
      remorse, into little pieces. You see my young master, or my young
      mistress, poring over one of their spiders’ insides with a
      magnifying-glass; or you meet one of their frogs walking downstairs
      without his head–and when you wonder what this cruel nastiness means,

    <p>By Sensations, in the strict meaning, we understand the mental

      action of external things on some part of the body, called on that
      account sensitive. Such are the feelings caused tastes, smells, sounds,
      or sights. These are the influences said to be external to the mental
      organisation; they are distinguished from influences originating
      within…, the remembrance of the past, or the anticipation of the
      future.</p>

    <p>Over the top of his head it was still of the deep black which was its
      natural colour. Round the sides of his head–without the slightest
      gradation of grey to break the force of the extraordinary contrast–it
      had turned completely white. The line between the two colours preserved
      no sort of regularity. At one place, the white hair ran up into the

    <p>Connecting the few words about himself which thus reluctantly escaped
      him, with the melancholy view of life which led him to place the
      conditions of human happiness in complete oblivion of the past, I felt
      satisfied that the story which I had read in his face was, in two
      particulars at least, the story that it really told. He had suffered as
      few men suffer; and there was the mixture of some foreign race in his

      had vowed to dedicate to Betteredge–until it suddenly occurred to me
      that here was the irrepressible Ezra Jennings getting in my way again! I
      threw a dozen portraits, at least, of the man with the piebald hair (the
      hair in every case, remarkably like), into the waste-paper basket–and
      then and there, wrote my answer to Betteredge.</p>

    <p>The tide was on the turn, and the horrid sand began to shiver. The
      broad brown face of it heaved slowly, and then dimpled and quivered all
      over. “Do you know what it looks like to ME?” says Rosanna, catching me
      by the shoulder again. “It looks as if it had hundreds of suffocating

    <p>It was now the time of the turn of the tide: and even as I stood

    <p>Even the lonely little bay welcomed the morning with a show of
      cheerfulness; and the bared wet surface of the quicksand itself,
      glittering with a golden brightness, hid the horror of its false brown
      face under a passing smile….</p>
    <p>The turn of the tide came, before my cigar was finished. I saw the
      preliminary heaving of the Sand, and then the awful shiver that crept
      over its surface–as if some spirit of terror lived and moved and
      shuddered in the fathomless deeps beneath.</p>
