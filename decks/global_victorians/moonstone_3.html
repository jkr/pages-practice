	    <p>NOTE. ADDED BY FRANKLIN BLAKE.—Miss Clack may make her mind quite
	      easy on this point. Nothing will be added, altered or removed, in
	      her manuscript, or in any of the other manuscripts which pass
	      through my hands. Whatever opinions any of the writers may
	      express, whatever peculiarities of treatment may mark, and perhaps
	      in a literary sense, disfigure the narratives which I am now
	      collecting, not a line will be tampered with anywhere, from first
	      to last. As genuine documents they are sent to me–and as genuine
	      documents I shall preserve them, endorsed by the attestations of
	      witnesses who can speak to the facts. It only remains to be added
	      that “the person chiefly concerned” in Miss Clack’s narrative, is
	      happy enough at the present moment, not only to brave the smartest
	      exercise of Miss Clack’s pen, but even to recognise its
	      unquestionable value as <span class="fragment
	      highlight-current-green" data-fragment-index="2">an instrument for
	      the exhibition of Miss Clack’s character.</span></p>

	      word of it true. But she points out one objection. She says what I have
	      done so far isn’t in the least what I was wanted to do. I am asked to
	      tell the story of the Diamond and, instead of that, I have been telling
	      the story of my own self.</p>

	      to speak. I closed my eyes; I put his hand, in a kind of spiritual
	      self-forgetfulness, to my lips. He murmured a soft remonstrance. Oh the
	      ecstasy, the pure, unearthly ecstasy of that moment! I sat—I hardly know
	      on what—quite lost in my own exalted feelings. When I opened my eyes

	    <p>You have heard of beautiful young ladies falling in love at first

	      reformatory, with a plain face and a deformed shoulder, falling in love,
	      at first sight, with a gentleman who comes on a visit to her mistress’s
	      house, match me that, in the way of an absurdity, out of any story-book
	      in Christendom, if you can! I laughed till the tears rolled down my
	      cheeks. Penelope resented my merriment, in rather a strange way. “I
	      never knew you cruel before, father,” she said, very gently, and went
	      out. (46)</p>

	      way that may make you laugh. I undressed, and put the nightgown on me.

	      heart,” she said, “even now! You may trust in the shameful, shameful
	      weakness which can only struggle against you in this way!” She suddenly
	      let go of me—she threw up her hands, and wrung them frantically in the
	      air. “Any other woman living would shrink from the disgrace of touching

	      shifting backwards and forwards at certain seasons of the year, lies the
	      most horrible quicksand on the shores of Yorkshire. At the turn of the
	      tide, something goes on in the unknown deeps below, which sets the whole
	      face of the quicksand shivering and trembling in a manner most

	      It’s more lonely to me to be among the other servants, knowing I am not

	      at the reformatory doesn’t know, what a dreadful reproach honest people

	      <em>me</em>?” says Rosanna, catching me by the shoulder again. “It looks
	      as if it had hundreds of suffocating people under it–all struggling to
	      get to the surface, and all sinking lower and lower in the dreadful
	      deeps! Throw a stone in, Mr. Betteredge! Throw a stone in, and let’s see

	      further on, however, my patience was rewarded. In a narrow little
	      fissure, just within reach of my forefinger, I felt the chain.
	      Attempting, next, to follow it, by touch, in the direction of the
	      quicksand, I found my progress stopped by a thick growth of
	      seaweed–which had fastened itself into the fissure, no doubt, in the
	      time that had elapsed since Rosanna Spearman had chosen her

	      which was placed nearest to the quicksand, I determined to pursue the
	      search for the chain on a plan of my own. My idea was to “sound”
	      immediately under the rocks, on the chance of recovering the lost trace
	      of the chain at the point at which it entered the sand.</p>
