<p style="font-size: 98%;">They howled, and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what
thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity—like yours—the
thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar.
Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would
admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a
response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of
there being a meaning in it which you–you so remote from the night of
first ages—could comprehend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And observe, you are put to stern choice in this matter. You must
either made a tool of the creature, or a man of him. You cannot make
both. Men were not intended to work with the accuracy of tools, to be
precise and perfect in all their actions. If you will have that
precision out of them, and make their fingers measure degrees like
cog-wheels, and their arms strike curves like compasses, you must
unhumanize them. (Ruskin, “Nature of the Gothic”)</p>

<section>
<blockquote>
<p>The teachings of <em>Unto This Last</em> I understood to be</p>
<ol>
<li>That the good of the individual is contained in the good of
all.</li>
<li>That a lawyer’s work has the same value as the barber’s inasmuch
as all have the same right of earning their livelihood from their
work.</li>
<li>That a life of labour, <em>i.e.</em>, the life of the tiller of
the soil and the handicraftsman is the life worth living.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The first of these I knew. The second I had dimly realized. The third
had never occurred to me. <em>Unto This Last</em> made it as clear as
daylight for me that the second and the third were contained in the
first. I arose with the dawn, ready to reduce these principles to
practice. (Gandhi, IV.18)</p>

<p>“It looks very much
like how the Fanti women prepare to do their washing in the brook, and
it is curious the mention of the use of oil to anoint the body after a
  bath. Why, that’s just what our people do.”</p>

<p>“Good; powers of observation fair, my boy,” remarked Kwamankra
proudly. “You see in these extra-civilised days the laundress and the
charwoman do the cleansing of our soiled linen, and who would dream of
seeing a king’s daughter doing her own washing, let alone her father’s,
or her brother’s. Yet, in ancient Greece it was not so. The highest in
birth preserved native simplicity, much as the unspoilt among our own
people do unto this day.” (<em>Ethiopia Unbound</em>, Ch. 19)</p>
