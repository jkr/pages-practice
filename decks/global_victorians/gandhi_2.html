	    <p>When I began the last chapter I gave it the heading I have given to

	      experiences with Europeans, I must write something by way of a preface.
	      This I did and altered the heading.</p>
	    <p>Now again, as I start on this chapter, I find myself confronted with
	      a fresh problem. What things to mention and what to omit regarding the
	      English friends of whom I am about to write is a serious problem. If
	      things that are relevant are omitted, truth will be dimmed.(IV.11)</p>

	    <p>Towards the end of my second year in England I came across two
	      Theosophists, brothers, and both unmarried. They talked to me about the
	      Gita. They were reading Sir Edwin Arnold’s translation—The Song
	      Celestial—- and they invited me to read the original with them. I felt
	      ashamed, as I had read the divine poem neither in Samskrit nor in
	      Gujarati. I was constrained to tell them that I had not read the Gita,
	      but that I would gladly read it with them, and that though my knowledge
	      of Samskrit was meagre, still I hoped to be able to understand the
	      original to the extent of telling where the translation failed to bring
	      out the meaning. I began reading the <em>Gita</em> with them. (I.20)</p>

	      as the book par excellence for the knowledge of Truth. It has afforded
	      me invaluable help in my moments of gloom. I have read almost all the
	      English translations of it, and I regard Sir Edwin Arnold’s as the best.
	      He has been faithful to the text, and yet it does not read like a

	    <p>Theosophist friends certainly intended to draw me into their society,

	      Theosophical literature is replete with Hindu influence, and so these
	      friends expected that I should be helpful to them. I explained that my
	      Samskrit study was not much to speak of, that I had not read the Hindu
	      scriptures in the original, and that even my acquaintance with the
	      translations was of the slightest. (IV.5)</p>
