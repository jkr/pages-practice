	    <p>The novelty lay in the heroine being, not a picturesque Italian of
	      the fourteenth century, but an English gentlewoman of the current year,
	      familiar with the use of the railway and the telegraph. The intense
	      probability of the story is constantly reiterated. Modern England—the
	      England of to-day’s newspaper—crops up at every step.</p>

	      only ready-made, but approved beforehand as of the true sensation cast.
	      Then, before the public interest has had time to cool, let him serve up
	      the exciting viands in a réchauffé with a proper amount of fictitious
	      seasoning; and there emerges the criminal variety of the Newspaper
	      Novel, a class of fiction having about the same relation to the genuine

	      light grey, had a very disconcerting trick, when they encountered your
	      eyes, of looking as if they expected something more from you than you
	      were aware of yourself. His walk was soft; his voice was melancholy; his
	      long lanky fingers were hooked like claws. He might have been a parson,
	      or an undertaker—or anything else you like, except what he really was. A

	      some family matters; and, among other things, we have been talking of
	      the loss of the Indian Diamond, in my aunt’s house in Yorkshire, two
	      years since. Mr. Bruff thinks as I think, that the whole story ought, in

	      the drawing-room I found more cheering opportunities of emptying my bag.
