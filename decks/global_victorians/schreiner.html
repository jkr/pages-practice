	      spree they had up Bulawayo way, hanging those three n——s for spies? I
	      wasn’t there myself, but a fellow who was told me they made the n——s
	      jump down from the tree and hang themselves; one fellow wouldn’t bally
	      jump, till they gave him a charge of buckshot in the back: and then he

	      his brain like the discharge of a battery of artillery. Then he thought
	      suddenly of a black woman he and another man caught alone in the bush,
	      her baby on her back, but young and pretty. Well, they didn’t shoot
	      her!–and a black woman wasn’t white! His mother didn’t understand these

	      such in the world, measuring each of them at least fifteen thousand feet
	      in height, standing not more than a dozen miles apart, linked together
	      by a precipitous cliff of rock, and towering in awful white solemnity
	      straight into the sky. These mountains placed thus, like the pillars of

	      table-topped mountains, something like the world-famed one at Cape Town;
