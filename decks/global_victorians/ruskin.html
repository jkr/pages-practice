	      cloaked under due laws-of-war, named ‘fair competition’ and so forth, it
	      is a mutual hostility. We have profoundly forgotten everywhere that
	      <em>Cash-payment</em> is not the sole relation of human beings; we
	      think, nothing doubting, that it absolves and liquidates all engagements
	      of man. “My starving workers?” answers the rich Mill-owner: “Did not I
	      hire them fairly in the market? Did I not pay them, to the last
	      sixpence, the sum covenanted for? What have I to do with them

	    <p>when that fallen Roman, in the utmost impotence of his luxury, and
	      insolence of his guilt, became the model for the imitation of civilized
	      Europe, at the close of the so-called Dark ages, the word Gothic became

	    <p>…As far as the epithet was used scornfully, it was used falsely; but
	      there is no reproach in the word, rightly understood; on the contrary,
	      there is a profound truth, which the instinct of mankind almost
	      unconsciously recognizes. It is true, greatly and deeply true, that the
	      architecture of the North is rude and wild; but it is not true, that,
	      for this reason, we are to condemn it, or despise. Far otherwise: I
	      believe it is in this very character that it deserves our profoundest

	      could endure the appearance of imperfection in anything; and, therefore,
	      what ornament he appointed to be done by those beneath him was composed
	      of mere geometrical forms,—balls, ridges, and perfectly symmetrical
	      foliage,—which could be executed with absolute precision by line and
	      rule, and were as perfect in their way when completed, as his own figure

	      once. Out come all his roughness, all his dulness, all his incapability;
	      shame upon shame, failure upon failure, pause after pause: but out comes
	      the whole majesty of him also; and we know the height of it only, when

	      accurate mouldings, and perfect polishings, and unerring adjustments of
	      the seasoned wood and tempered steel. Many a time you have exulted over
	      them, and thought how great England was, because her slightest work was
