<p>The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end
to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn
asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural
superiors,” and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man
than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned
the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous
enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of
egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange
value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms,
has set up that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade… (11)</p>

  <h3>The Experience of the Modern</h3>
</section>

<section>
<blockquote>
<p>The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the
instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and
with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes
of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first
condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant
revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social
conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the
bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones... (12)</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="the-experience-of-the-modern-1">
<blockquote>
  <p>
    ... All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable
prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated
before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is
profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real
conditions of life, and his relations with his kind. (12)</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="the-experience-of-the-modern-2">
<blockquote>
<p>Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make
up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable… The
aim for the artist is to extract from fashion the poetry that resides in
its historical envelope, to distill the eternal from the transitory

<p>All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are
daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose
introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised
nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material,
but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose
products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the
globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the
country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the
products of distant lands and climes... (12–13)</p>

<p>...In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we
have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And
as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations
of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and
narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous
national and local literatures, there arises a world literature. (12–13)</p>
