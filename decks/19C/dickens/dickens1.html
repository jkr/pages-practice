The deep remembrance of the sense I had of being utterly neglected and
hopeless; of the shame I felt in my position; of the misery it was to my
young heart... cannot be written. Even now, famous and
caressed and happy, I often forget in my dreams that I have a dear wife
and children; even that I am a man; and wander desolately back to that
time of my life.

	<section><h3>The Blacking Factory</h3></section>

	<section>
<blockquote>
<p>It is wonderful to me how I could have been so easily cast away at
such an age. It is wonderful to me, that, even after my descent into the
poor little drudge I had been since we came to London, no one had
compassion enough on me—a child of singular abilities, quick, eager,
delicate, and soon hurt, bodily or mentally—to suggest that something
might have been spared, as certainly it might have been, to place me at
any common school. Our friends, I take it, were tired out. No one made
any sign. My father and mother were quite satisfied. They could hardly
have been more so, if I had been twenty years of age, distinguished at a
grammar-school, and going to Cambridge.</p>
</blockquote>
	</section>
	<section>
<blockquote>
<p>The blacking warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of
the way, at old Hungerford-stairs. It was a crazy, tumbledown old house,
abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its
wainscotted rooms and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey
rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and
scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of
the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The
counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and
the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work.</p>
</blockquote>
	</section>
	<section>
<blockquote>
<p>My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece
of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round
with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round,
until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary’s shop.
When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of
perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label; and then go on again
with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty
downstairs on similar wages</p>
</blockquote>

	<section>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into
	      this companionship; compared these every day associates with those
	      of my happier childhood; and felt my early hopes of growing up to
	      be a learned and distinguished man, crushed in my breast. The deep
	      remembrance of the sense I had of being utterly neglected and
	      hopeless; of the shame I felt in my position; of the misery it was
	      to my young heart to believe that, day by day, what I had learned,
	      and thought, and delighted in, and raised my fancy and my
	      emulation up by, was passing away from me, never to be brought
	      back any more; <span>[</span>all this<span>]</span> cannot be
	      written.</p>

	      children; even that I am a man; and wander desolately back to that

<section>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest humourist whom England ever produced&mdash;Shakespeare
certainly not excepted&mdash;is gone…<br />
(Obituary in the <em>Spectator</em>)</p>
<p>Charles Dickens, the most popular novelist of the century, and one of
the greatest humorists that England has produced, was born at Landport
in Portsea on Friday, the 7th of February, 1812.<br />
(Opening of <em>The Life of Charles Dickens</em>, John Forster,
1872)</p>

<p>in no other perfectly sane mind… have I observed vividness of
imagination approaching so closely to hallucination. (G. H. Lewes)</p>

<section><h3>Opaque language</h3></section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>My father’s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip,
my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more
explicit than Pip. (3)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>The shape of the letters on my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he
was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character
and turn of the inscription, “Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,” I drew
a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. (3)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family
tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My
construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I
read “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father’s
exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations
had been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formed
the worst opinions of that member of the family. … (39)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>… Neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my
Catechism bound me, at all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance
that I supposed my declaration that I was to “walk in the same all the
days of my life,” laid me under an obligation always to go through the
village from our house in one particular direction, and never to vary it
by turning down by the wheelwright’s or up by the mill. (39)</p>

<p>“He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,
before our first game was out. “And what coarse hands he has! And what
thick boots!” (55)</p>
