never like Joe’s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.

<p>I am not at all happy as I am. I am disgusted with my calling and
with my life. … Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall
or can be comfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I
can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now.

<p>“He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,
before our first game was out. “And what coarse hands he has! And what
thick boots!”</p>
<p>I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began
to consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so
strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it. (55)</p>

<p>So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at Miss
Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge;
pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply revolving that
I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse; that my boots
were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves
Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last
night, and generally that I was in a low-lived bad way. (59)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What I
dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and
commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of
the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she
would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing
the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.…

<p>… Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we
were singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at
Miss Havisham’s would seem to show me Estella’s face in the fire, with
her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,—often
at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the
wall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her
just drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.

<p>I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good fellow—I <em>know</em> I

Havisham’s chair, and that her eyes laughed mischievously. (92)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every writer of fiction, although he may not adopt the dramatic from,
writes in effect for the stage. He may never write plays; but the truth
and passion which are in him must be more or less reflected in the great
mirror which he holds up to nature. (Speech to the General Theatrical
Fund, 1858)</p>

<p>When produced in St. James’s Hall, Tuesday evening, January 5th,
1869, the effect of the “Sikes and Nancy” reading was all that Dickens
had anticipated from a financial point of view, and from an
<em>artistic</em> point of view, he had no reason to be disappointed;
but in the vigor and earnestness with which it was delivered, it was
painfully apparent to his most intimate friends, and those who knew his
state of health the best, that a too-frequent repetition of it would
seriously and permanently affect his constitution.…</p>

	<section>
<blockquote>
<p>The terrible force with which the actual perpetration of this most
foul murder was described was of such a kind to render Mr. Dickens
utterly prostrate for some moments after its delivery, and it was not
until he had vanished from the platform, that the public had
sufficiently recovered their sense of composure to appreciate that all
the horrors to which they had been listening were but a story and not a
reality. (<em>American Magazine</em>, 1885)</p>

<p>I couldn’t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of
the table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger
his glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink
the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with
unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning
round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and
rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,
violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and
apparently out of his mind. (26)</p>

<p>In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity between
seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did his
shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the
corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor
about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew
which was which. (49)</p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>What <span>[</span>Dickens<span>]</span> does not noticeably write
about, however, is <em>work</em>… In Dickens’s novels anything in the
nature of work happens off-stage. The only one of his heroes who has a
plausible profession is David Copperfield, who is first a shorthand
writer and then a novelist, like Dickens himself. With most of the
others, the way they earn their living is very much in the background. …
Dickens knows very little about the professions his characters are
supposed to follow… As soon as he has to deal with trade, finance,
industry or politics he takes refuge in vagueness, or in satire…
(Orwell, "Charles Dickens", 1940)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>…the typical Dickens novel, <em>Nicholas Nickleby</em>, <em>Oliver
Twist</em>, <em>Martin Chuzzlewit</em>, <em>Our Mutual Friend</em>,
always exists round a framework of melodrama. The last thing anyone ever
remembers about the books is their central story. On the other hand, I
suppose no one has ever read them without carrying the memory of
individual pages to the day of his death. Dickens sees human beings with
the most intense vividness, but sees them always in private life, as
‘characters’, not as functional members of society; that is to say, he
sees them statically. (Orwell, "Charles Dickens", 1940)</p>

<p>“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen the
Aged. Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life
is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and
when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it’s not
in any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same. I
don’t wish it professionally spoken about.” (190-91)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and this
office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is
another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments
must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken
in this office.” (266)</p>

<p><span style="font-size:85%;"> my guardian had a woman under examination or
cross-examination,&mdash;I don’t know which,&mdash;and was striking her, and the
bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever
degree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required to
have it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said,
“I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, he said,
“Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite of
his finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words,
and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which
side he was on I couldn’t make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding
the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe,
he was not on the side of the bench (185) </span></p>
