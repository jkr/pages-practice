<section><blockquote>
<p>What <span>[</span>Dickens<span>]</span> does not noticeably write
about, however, is <em>work</em>… In Dickens’s novels anything in the
nature of work happens off-stage. The only one of his heroes who has a
plausible profession is David Copperfield, who is first a shorthand
writer and then a novelist, like Dickens himself. With most of the
others, the way they earn their living is very much in the background. …
Dickens knows very little about the professions his characters are
supposed to follow… As soon as he has to deal with trade, finance,
industry or politics he takes refuge in vagueness, or in satire…
(Orwell, "Charles Dickens", 1940)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>…the typical Dickens novel, <em>Nicholas Nickleby</em>, <em>Oliver
Twist</em>, <em>Martin Chuzzlewit</em>, <em>Our Mutual Friend</em>,
always exists round a framework of melodrama. The last thing anyone ever
remembers about the books is their central story. On the other hand, I
suppose no one has ever read them without carrying the memory of
individual pages to the day of his death. Dickens sees human beings with
the most intense vividness, but sees them always in private life, as
‘characters’, not as functional members of society; that is to say, he
sees them statically. (Orwell, "Charles Dickens", 1940)</p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen the
Aged. Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life
is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and
when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it’s not
in any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same. I
don’t wish it professionally spoken about.” (190-91)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and this
office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is
another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments
must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken
in this office.” (266)</p>

    <p>I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.

“That’s a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays I run up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I hoist it up&mdash;so&mdash;and cut off the communication.”

The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two
      deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it
      up and made it fast..

  <blockquote style="font-size:95%;">
    <p>Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him cleaning
    my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from my gothic
    window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a most devoted
    manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at half-past eight
    precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and
    harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened into a post-office again.
    At last, when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from
    his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the
    Castle and the drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and
    the Aged, had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of
      the Stinger.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:85%;"> my guardian had a woman under examination or
cross-examination,&mdash;I don’t know which,&mdash;and was striking her, and the
bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever
degree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required to
have it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said,
“I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, he said,
“Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite of
his finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words,
and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which
side he was on I couldn’t make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding
the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe,
he was not on the side of the bench (185) </span></p>

bestowing the finishing gift. (143)</p>

apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you never
take warning?”</p>
<p>“Of what?”</p>
<p>“Of me.”</p>
<p>“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?”</p>

<p>I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for
the reason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of my
miseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,
when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My dread
always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy
disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious
struggle in her bosom. (275)</p>

<p>And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look’ee here, to know
in secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them
colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I
say? I says to myself, “I’m making a better gentleman nor ever you’ll
be!” When one of ’em says to another, “He was a convict, a few year ago,
and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he’s lucky,” what do I say?
I says to myself, “If I ain’t a gentleman, nor yet ain’t got no
learning, I’m the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which
on you owns a brought-up London gentleman?” This way I kep myself a
going. (293)</p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>I mustn’t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;
there mustn’t be no mud on his boots. My gentleman must have horses,
Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to
ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood
’uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? (300)</p>

<p>“Look’ee here!” he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and
turning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his touch
as if he had been a snake, “a gold ’un and a beauty: <em>that’s</em> a
gentleman’s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies;
<em>that’s</em> a gentleman’s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and
beautiful! Look at your clothes; better ain’t to be got! And your books
too,” turning his eyes round the room, “mounting up, on their shelves,
by hundreds! And you read ’em; don’t you? I see you’d been a reading of
’em when I come in. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read ’em to me, dear boy! And
if they’re in foreign languages wot I don’t understand, I shall be just
as proud as if I did.” (293)</p>

<p>As we got more and more into debt, breakfast became a hollower and
hollower form, and, being on one occasion at breakfast-time threatened
(by letter) with legal proceedings, “not unwholly unconnected,” as my
local paper might put it, “with jewelery.” (251)</p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>In the interval, Miss Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of
the most beautiful jewels from her dressing-table into Estella’s hair,
and about her bosom and arms. (222)</p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>“It is a part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella,
with a sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and
see her regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they are
nearly all mine now.” (247)</p>
