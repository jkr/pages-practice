…the notion that <span>[</span>Pip<span>]</span> could ever have been
happy with Estella: indeed that anyone could have been happy with
Estella, is positively unpleasant. … <span>[</span><em>Great
Expectations</em><span>]</span> is too serious a book to be a trivially
happy one. Its beginning is unhappy; its middle is unhappy; and the
conventional happy ending is an outrage on it.

<p>On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that
country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court.
The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a
noble boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable
Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in
life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of
white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My
gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have
wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable. (231)</p>

<p>GHOST:<br />
I am thy father’s spirit,<br />
Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night,<br />
And for the day confined to fast in fires,<br />
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br />
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid<br />
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br />
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br />
Would harrow up thy soul<br />
…<br />
List, list, O, list!<br />
If thou didst ever thy dear father love—<br />

<p>What he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his
hair, and give us Mark Antony’s oration over the body of Caesar. This
was always followed by Collins’s Ode on the Passions, wherein I
particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained
sword in thunder down, and taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a
withering look. (40)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella,
and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that
I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert’s Clara, or play Hamlet to
Miss Havisham’s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing
twenty words of it. (236)</p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy in
boots,—top boots,—in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said
to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of the refuse of
my washerwoman’s family), and had clothed him with a blue coat, canary
waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots already
mentioned… (200)</p>

<p>he would ask me to read to him,—“Foreign language, dear boy!” While I
complied, he, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the
fire surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him,
between the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing
in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The
imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously
made, was not more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made
me, and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he
admired me and the fonder he was of me. (310)</p>

<p>“Wolf!” said he, folding his arms again, “Old Orlick’s a going to
tell you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.”</p>
<p>Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted
the whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her
death, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.</p>
<p>“It was you, villain,” said I.</p>

<p>“I tell you it was your doing,—I tell you it was done through you,”
he retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at
the vacant air between us. “I come upon her from behind, as I come upon
you to-night. I giv’ it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been
a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn’t have come
to life again. But it warn’t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was
favored, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?
Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.” (389)</p>

<p>She had been struck with something blunt and heavy, on the head and
spine; after the blows were dealt, something heavy had been thrown down
at her with considerable violence, as she lay on her face. And on the
ground beside her, when Joe picked her up, was a convict’s leg-iron
which had been filed asunder. (109)</p>

    Drummle</h3></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>I was very glad afterwards to have had the interview; for, in her
face and her voice, and in her touch, she gave me the assurance, that
suffering had been stronger than Miss Havisham’s teaching, and had given
her a heart to understand what my heart used to be. (444)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>And if you could say that to me then, you will not hesitate to say
that to me now,—now, when suffering has been stronger than all other
teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I
have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into a better shape. Be as
considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are friends.

<p>I saw him through the window, seizing his horse’s mane, and mounting
in his blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought
he was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his
mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-colored dress appeared
with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where: whether from the
inn yard, or the street, or where not,—and as Drummle leaned down from
the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his head
towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged hair
of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick. (327)</p>

<p>Biddy, I think you once liked me very well, when my errant heart,
even while it strayed away from you, was quieter and better with you
than it ever has been since. If you can like me only half as well once
more, if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my
head, if you can receive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as
sorry, Biddy, and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing
hand), I hope I am a little worthier of you that I was—not much, but a
little. …</p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>And, Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the
forge with Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down
in this country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an
opportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until I
knew your answer. And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will
go through the world with me, you will surely make it a better world for
me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it a better
world for you. (431)</p>

<p>Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of
the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a
guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had
proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my
heart was softened by my return… (436)</p>

<p>I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House,

but we had a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well.
