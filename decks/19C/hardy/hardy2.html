      <section><blockquote>
          <p>The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach
          again the spot of the accident. Prince had lain there in
          the ditch since the morning; but the place of the
          blood-pool was still visible in the middle of the road,
          though scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles.
          All that was left of Prince was now hoisted into the
          waggon he had formerly hauled, and with his hoofs in the
          air, and his shoes shining in the setting sunlight, he
          retraced the eight or nine miles to Marlott. (39)</p>
      </blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote style="font-size:94%;">
          <p>D’Urberville gave her the kiss of mastery. No sooner
          had he done so than she flushed with shame, took out her
          handkerchief, and wiped the spot on her cheek that had
          been touched by his lips. His ardour was nettled at the
          sight, for the act on her part had been unconsciously
          done.</p>

          <p>“You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!” said
          the young man.</p>

          <p>Tess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed,
          she did not quite comprehend the drift, unheeding the
          snub she had administered by her instinctive rub upon her
          cheek. She had, in fact, undone the kiss, as far as such
          a thing was physically possible. (61)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>He knelt and bent lower, till her breath warmed his
          face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers.
          She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there
          lingered tears. (82)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section>
	<blockquote style="font-size:98%;">
          <p>Alec d’Urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her,
          and said–</p>

          <p>"You are not going to turn away like that, dear!
          Come!"</p>

          <p>“If you wish,” she answered indifferently. “See how
          you’ve mastered me!”</p>

          <p>She thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his,
          and remained like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss
          upon her cheek–half perfunctorily, half as if zest had
          not yet quite died out. Her eyes vaguely rested upon the
          remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was given, as
          though she were nearly unconscious of what he did. &hellip;(90)</p>

	<section>
	<blockquote>
          <p>&hellip; “Now the other side, for old acquaintance’ sake.”</p>

          <p>She turned her head in the same passive way, as one
          might turn at the request of a sketcher or hairdresser,
          and he kissed the other side, his lips touching cheeks
          that were damp and smoothly chill as the skin of the
          mushrooms in the fields around. (90)</p>
	</blockquote>

	<section>
	  <blockquote>
          <p>though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a
	    morality good enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human
	    nature; and it therefore does not mend the matter. (82)
          </p>
	  </blockquote>
	</section>
	  

	<section>
	  <blockquote>
          <p>Yet even now Tess felt the pulse of hopeful life still
          warm within her; she might be happy in some nook which
          had no memories. To escape the past and all that
          appertained thereto was to annihilate it, and to do that
          she would have to get away.</p>

          <p>Was once lost always lost really true of chastity? she
          would ask herself. She might prove it false if she could
          veil bygones. The recuperative power which pervaded
          organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone.

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Respecting the sub-title…I may add that it was
          appended at the last moment, after reading the final
          proofs, as being the estimate left in a candid mind of
          the heroine’s—an estimate nobody would be likely to
          dispute. It was more disputed than anything else in the
          book. (7–8) [1912 Preface]</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>She looked absolutely pure. Nature, in her fantastic
          trickery, had set such a seal of maidenhood upon Tess’s
          countenance that he gazed at her with a stupefied air.

          <p>He made love to me, as you said he would do; and he
          asked me to marry him, also just as you declared he
          would. I never have liked him; but at last I agreed,
          knowing you’d be angry, if I didn’t. He said, it must be
          private even from you, on account of his mother; and by
          special license; and foolish I agreed to that likewise,
          to get rid of his pestering. I drove with him to
          Melchester, and there in a private room I went through
          the form of marriage with him as before a registrar. A
          few weeks after, I found out that it was not the
          registrar’s house we had gone to, as I had supposed, but
          the house of a friend of his, who had played the part of
          the registrar. I then came away from Trantridge
          instantly, though he wished me to stay, and here I am.

	<section><blockquote>

          <p>Clare’s character [in the serial] suffers from a mock
          marriage having been substituted for the seduction pure
          &amp; simple of the original MS.—which I did for the sake
          of the Young Girl. The true reading will be restored in
          the volumes. [Letter, 1891]</p>

          <p>If I had gone for love o’ you, if I had ever sincerely
          loved you, if I loved you still, I should not so loathe
          and hate myself for my weakness as I do now!…My eyes were
          dazed by you for a little, and that was all. (89)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>She had never wholly cared for him; she did not at all
          care for him now. She had dreaded him, winced before him,
          succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her
          helplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent
          manners, had been stirred to confused surrender awhile:
          had suddenly despised and disliked him, and had run away.
          That was all. Hate him she did not quite; but he was dust
          and ashes to her, and even for her name’s sake she
          scarcely wished to marry him. (94)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue,
          sensitive as gossamer, and practically blank as snow as
          yet, there should have been traced such a coarse pattern
          as it was doomed to receive; why so often the coarse
          appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the woman, the
          wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical
          philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order.
          One may, indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution
          lurking in the present catastrophe. Doubtless some of
          Tess d’Urberville’s mailed ancestors rollicking home from
          a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly
          towards peasant girls of their time. (82)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Then Tess went up to her mother, put her face upon
          Joan’s neck, and told. (93)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>She bent forward, at which each diamond on her neck
          gave a sinister wink like a toad’s; and pressing her
          forehead against his temple she entered on her story of
          her acquaintance with Alec d’Urberville and its results,
          murmuring the words without flinching, and with her
          eyelids drooping down. (244)</p>

          <p>“The trees have inquisitive eyes, haven’t they?—that
          is, seem as if they had. And the river says,—‘Why do ye
          trouble me with your looks?’ And you seem to see numbers
          of to-morrows just all in a line, the first of them the
          biggest and clearest, the others getting smaller and
          smaller as they stand farther away; but they all seem
          very fierce and cruel and as if they said, ‘I’m coming!
          Beware of me! Beware of me!’ ... But <em>you</em>, sir,

          <p>&hellip;[Angel] was surprised to find this young woman—who
          though but a milkmaid had just that touch of rarity about
          her which might make her the envied of her
          housemates—shaping such sad imaginings. She was
          expressing in her own native phrases–assisted a little by
          her Sixth Standard training—feelings which might almost
          have been called those of the age—the ache of modernism.
          (139–40)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>The perception arrested him less when he reflected
          that what are called advanced ideas are really in great
          part but the latest fashion in definition–a more accurate
          expression, by words in <em>logy</em> and <em>ism</em>,
          of sensations which men and women have vaguely grasped
          for centuries. (140)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>…what’s the use of learning that I am one of a long
          row only—finding out that there is set down in some old
          book somebody just like me, and to know that I shall only
          act her part; making me sad, that’s all. The best is not
          to remember that your nature and your past doings have
          been just like thousands’ and thousands’, and that your
          coming life and doings ’ll be like thousands’ and
          thousands’. (142)</p>

          <p>“How can you dare to use such words!” she cried,
          turning impetuously upon him, her eyes flashing as the
          latent spirit of which he was to see more some day awoke
          in her. (89)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Thus the thing began. Had she perceived this meeting’s
          import she might have asked why she was doomed to be seen
          and coveted that day by the wrong man, and not by some
          other man, the right and desired one in all respects–as
          nearly as humanity can supply the right and desired; yet
          to him who amongst her acquaintance might have
          approximated to this kind, she was but a transient
          impression, half forgotten. (48)</p>

          <p>As Tess’s own people down in those retreats are never
          tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way:
          “It was to be.” There lay the pity of it. An immeasurable
          social chasm was to divide our heroine’s personality
          thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped
          from her mother’s door to try her fortune at Trantridge
          poultry-farm. (83)</p>
