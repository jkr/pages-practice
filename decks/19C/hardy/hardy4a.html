	    <p>…as the long holdings fell in, they were seldom again let to
	      similar tenants, and were mostly pulled down, if not absolutely
	      required by the farmer for his hands. Cottagers who were not
	      directly employed on the land were looked upon with disfavour, and
	      the banishment of some starved the trade of others, who were thus
	      obliged to follow. These families, who had formed the backbone of
	      the village life in the past, who were the depositaries of the
	      village traditions, had to seek refuge in the large centres; the
	      process, humorously designated by statisticians as “the tendency
	      of the rural population towards the large towns,” being really the
	      tendency of water to flow uphill <span class="fragment

	      separated her from Marian and Izz, and prevented their changing duties
	      with her as they had done. The incessant quivering, in which every fibre
	      of her frame participated, had thrown her into a stupefied reverie in
	      which her arms worked on independently of her consciousness. She hardly
	      knew where she was, and did not hear Izz Huett tell her from below that
	      her hair was tumbling down. (353–54)</p>
