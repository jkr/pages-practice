	    we now seldom hear the agencies which we see still at
            work, spoken of as trifling and insignificant, when used
            in explaining the excavation of the deepest valleys or the
            formation of long lines of inland cliffs. Natural
            selection acts only by the preservation and accumulation
            of small inherited modifications, each profitable to the
            preserved being; and as modern geology has almost banished
            such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single
            diluvial wave, so will natural selection banish the belief
            of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any
            great and sudden modification in their
            structure. (<em>Origin</em>)

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Mrs Durbeyfield habitually spoke the dialect; her
          daughter, who had passed the Sixth Standard in the
          National School under a London-trained mistress, spoke
          two languages: the dialect at home, more or less;
          ordinary English abroad and to persons of quality.
          (27)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Between the mother, with her fast-perishing lumber of
          superstitions, folk-lore, dialect, and orally transmitted
          ballads, and the daughter, with her trained National
          teachings and Standard knowledge under an infinitely
          Revised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years as
          ordinarily understood. When they were together the
          Jacobean and the Victorian ages were juxtaposed. (29)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still. As
          she walked along to-day, for all her bouncing handsome
          womanliness, you could sometimes see her twelfth year in
          her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling from her eyes; and
          even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth
          now and then. (21)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>She had dreamed of an aged and dignified face, the
          sublimation of all the d’Urberville lineaments, furrowed
          with incarnate memories, representing in hieroglyphic the
          centuries of her family’s and England’s history. (45)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>The river had stolen from the higher tracts and
          brought in particles to the vale all this horizontal
          land; and now, exhausted, aged, and attenuated, lay
          serpentining long through the midst of its former spoils.

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of
          his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its
          brim where his thumb came in taking it off. (14)</p>

	  <p>Out of that tub had come the day before—Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse–the very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass—which had been wrung up and ironed by her mother’s own hands. (26)</p>

	    <p>The regular seriess of thumpings from the interior of the house, occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone floor. (25)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
	  <p>The cradle-rockers had done hard duty for so many years, under the weight of so many children, on that flag-stone floor, that they were worn nearly flat, in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each swing of the cot. (26)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
	  <p>The <em>Compleat Fortune-Teller</em> was an old thick
	  volume, which lay on a table at her elbow, so worn by
	  pocketing that the margins had reached the edge of the
	    type. (28–29)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>	
	  <p>The milking progressed, till towards the end Tess and
	  Clare, in common with the rest, could hear the heavy
	  breakfast table dragged out from the wall in the kitchen by
	  Mrs Crick, this being the invariable preliminary to each
	  meal; the same horrible scrape accompanying its return
	    journey when the table had been cleared. (147)</p>

          <p>…he asked her if she liked strawberries.</p>

          <p>“Yes,” said Tess, “when they come.”</p>

          <p>“They are already here.” D’Urberville began gathering
          specimens of the fruit for her, handing them back to her
          as he stooped; and, presently, selecting a specially fine
          product of the “British Queen” variety, he stood up and
          held it by the stem to her mouth.</p>

          <p>“No—no!” she said quickly, putting her fingers between
          his hand and her lips. “I would rather take it in my own
          hand.”</p>

          <p>“Nonsense!” he insisted; and in a slight distress she
          parted her lips and took it in. (47)</p>

          <p>The pouted-up deep red mouth to which this syllable
          was native had hardly as yet settled into its definite
          shape, and her lower lip had a way of thrusting the
          middle of her top one upward, when they closed together
          after a word. (21)</p>

      <section><blockquote>
          <p>The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach
          again the spot of the accident. Prince had lain there in
          the ditch since the morning; but the place of the
          blood-pool was still visible in the middle of the road,
          though scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles.
          All that was left of Prince was now hoisted into the
          waggon he had formerly hauled, and with his hoofs in the
          air, and his shoes shining in the setting sunlight, he
          retraced the eight or nine miles to Marlott. (39)</p>
      </blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote style="font-size:94%;">
          <p>D’Urberville gave her the kiss of mastery. No sooner
          had he done so than she flushed with shame, took out her
          handkerchief, and wiped the spot on her cheek that had
          been touched by his lips. His ardour was nettled at the
          sight, for the act on her part had been unconsciously
          done.</p>

          <p>“You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!” said
          the young man.</p>

          <p>Tess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed,
          she did not quite comprehend the drift, unheeding the
          snub she had administered by her instinctive rub upon her
          cheek. She had, in fact, undone the kiss, as far as such
          a thing was physically possible. (61)</p>

          <p>He knelt and bent lower, till her breath warmed his
          face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers.
          She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there
          lingered tears. (82)</p>

	<section>
	<blockquote style="font-size:98%;">
          <p>Alec d’Urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her,
          and said–</p>

          <p>"You are not going to turn away like that, dear!
          Come!"</p>

          <p>“If you wish,” she answered indifferently. “See how
          you’ve mastered me!”</p>

          <p>She thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his,
          and remained like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss
          upon her cheek–half perfunctorily, half as if zest had
          not yet quite died out. Her eyes vaguely rested upon the
          remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was given, as
          though she were nearly unconscious of what he did. &hellip;(90)</p>

          <p>&hellip; “Now the other side, for old acquaintance’ sake.”</p>

          <p>She turned her head in the same passive way, as one
          might turn at the request of a sketcher or hairdresser,
          and he kissed the other side, his lips touching cheeks
          that were damp and smoothly chill as the skin of the
          mushrooms in the fields around. (90)</p>

	<section>
	  <blockquote>
          <p>though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the
children may be a morality good enough for divinities, it is scorned
by average human nature; and it therefore does not mend the
matter. (82)

	  </blockquote>
	</section>

	  

	<section>
	  <blockquote>
          <p>Yet even now Tess felt the pulse of hopeful life still
          warm within her; she might be happy in some nook which
          had no memories. To escape the past and all that
          appertained thereto was to annihilate it, and to do that
          she would have to get away.</p>

          <p>Was once lost always lost really true of chastity? she
          would ask herself. She might prove it false if she could
          veil bygones. The recuperative power which pervaded
          organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone.
