	    <p>In a few minutes he had reached the end of it, and
	    found himself facing a high grey-brick wall, wherein, at
	    this point, was an arched gateway closed with black
	    doors. He looked at the gateway, then fixed his gaze on
	    something that stood just above–something which the dusk
	    half concealed, and by so doing made more impressive. It
	    was the sculptured counterfeit of a human face, that of a

	      ...The eyes stared wildly from

	    forehead was wrung with torture, the cheeks sunken, the
	    throat fearsomely wasted, and from the wide lips there
	    seemed to be issuing a horrible cry. Above this hideous
	    effigy was carved the legend: ‘MIDDLESEX HOUSE OF

	    <p>Jane pleaded in inarticulate anguish. But Clem had
	    caught her by the arm, was dragging her on, on, till she
	    was at the very door of that ghastly death-cellar. Though
	    thirteen years old, her slight frame was as incapable of
	    resisting Clem Peckover’s muscles as an infant’s would
	    have been. The door was open, but at that moment Jane
	    uttered a shriek which rang and echoed through the whole
	    house. Startled, Clem relaxed her grasp. Jane tore herself
	    away, fled up the kitchen stairs, fled upwards still,
	    flung herself at the feet of someone who had come out on
	      to the landing and held a light. (37)</p>

	    <p>He lost his guiding interests, and found himself
	    returning to those of boyhood. The country once more
	    attracted him; he took out his old sketch-books, bought a
	    new one, revived the regret that he could not be a painter
	    of landscape. A visit to one or two picture-galleries, and
	    then again profound discouragement, recognition of the
	    fact that he was a mechanic and never could be anything
	      else. (58)</p>

	    <p>It was the end of his illusions. For him not even
 passionate love was to preserve the power of idealising its
 object. He loved Clara with all the desire of his being, but could no
 longer deceive himself in judging her character. The same sad
 clearness of vision affected his judgment of the world about him, of
 the activities in which he had once been zealous, of the conditions
 which enveloped his life and the lives of those dear to him. The
 spirit of revolt often enough stirred within him, but no longer found
 utterance in the speech which brings relief; he did his best to
	      dispel the mood, mocking at it as folly...</p>

	    <p>
	    ...Consciously he set himself the task of becoming a
	    practical man, of learning to make the best of life as he
	    found it, of shunning as the fatal error that habit of
	    mind which kept John Hewett on the rack. Who was he that
	    he should look for pleasant things in his course through
	    the world? “We are the lower orders; we are the working
	    classes,” he said bitterly to his friend, and that seemed
	    the final answer to all his aspirations. (58)</p>

	    <p>The boy had a noticeable turn for drawing and
	    colouring; at ten years old, when (as often happened) his
	    father took him for a Sunday in the country, he carried a
	    sketch-book and found his delight in using it. Sidney was
	    to be a draughtsman of some kind; perhaps an artist, if
	    all went well. Unhappily things went the reverse of
	    well. In his anxiety to improve his business, Mr. Kirkwood
	    invented a new kind of “composition” for printers’ use; he
	    patented it, risked capital upon it, made in a short time
	      some serious losses. (52)</p>

	    <p>One baby, two babies, three babies; before the birth of
	    the third, John’s brow was again clouded, again he had
	    begun to rail and fume at the unfitness of things. His
	    business was a failure, partly because he dealt with a too
	    rigid honesty, partly because of his unstable nature,
	    which left him at the mercy of whims and obstinacies and
	    airy projects. He did not risk the ordinary kind of
	    bankruptcy, but came down and down, until at length he was
	    the only workman in his own shop; then the shop itself had
	    to be abandoned; then he was searching for someone who
	      would employ him. (57)</p>

	    <p>Pennyloaf then put on her hat and jacket again and left

	    Clerkenwell, came to Sadler’s Wells Theatre (gloomy in its
	    profitless recollection of the last worthy manager that
	    London knew), and there turned into Myddelton Passage. It
	    is a narrow paved walk between brick walls seven feet
	    high; on the one hand lies the New River Head, on the
	    other are small gardens behind Myddelton Square. The
	    branches of a few trees hang over; there are doors,
	    seemingly never opened, belonging one to each garden; a

	    a policeman came along with echoing tread, and eyed her
	    suspiciously. She had to wait more than a quarter of an
	    hour before Bob Hewett made his appearance. Greeting her
	    with a nod and a laugh, he took up a leaning position
	    against the wall, and began to put questions concerning
	    the state of things at her home. (76–77)</p>

	    <p>The poor can seldom command privacy; their scenes alike
