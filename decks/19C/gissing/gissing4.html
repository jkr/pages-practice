	    <section><h3>Karl Marx</h3></section>

	    <section><blockquote>
	    <p>[T]he object that labour produces, its product, stands
	    opposed to it as <em>something alien</em>, as a <em>power
	    independent</em> of the producer. The product of labour is
	    labour embodied and made material in an object, it is
	      the <em>objectification</em> of labour.
	    (Marx, <em>Economic and Philosophical
	      Manuscripts</em>, 1844)</p>
	    </blockquote></section>

	      worker, i.e. does not belong to his essential being;

	      but denies himself, feels miserable and not happy, does

	      <section><h3>John Ruskin</h3></section>

	      <section><blockquote>
	    <p>And observe, you are put to stern choice in this
	    matter. You must either made a tool of the creature, or a
	    man of him. You cannot make both. Men were not intended to
	    work with the accuracy of tools, to be precise and perfect
	    in all their actions. If you will have that precision out
	    of them, and make their fingers measure degrees like
	    cog-wheels, and their arms strike curves like compasses,
	    you must unhumanize them. (Ruskin, <em>Nature of
	    Gothic</em>)</p>
	    </blockquote></section>

	    <section><blockquote>
	    <p>And now, reader, look round this English room of yours,
	    about which you have been proud so often, because the work
	    of it was so good and strong, and the ornaments of it so
	    finished. Examine again all those accurate mouldings, and
	    perfect polishings, and unerring adjustments of the
	    seasoned wood and tempered steel. Many a time you have
	    exulted over them, and thought how great England was,
	    because her slightest work was done so thoroughly. Alas!
	    if read rightly, these perfectnesses are signs of a
	    slavery in our England a thousand times more bitter and
	    more degrading than that of the scourged African, or helot
	      Greek...</p>
	    </blockquote></section>

	    <section><blockquote>
	    
	    ...Men may be beaten, chained, tormented, yoked like
	    cattle, slaughtered like summer flies, and yet remain in
	    one sense, and the best sense, free. But to smother their
	    souls within them, to blight and hew into rotting pollards
	    the suckling branches of their human intelligence, to make
	    the flesh and skin which, after the worm’s work on it, is
	    to see God, into leathern thongs to yoke machinery
	    with,–this it is to be slave-masters indeed;...</p>
	    </blockquote></section>

	    <section><blockquote>
	    <p>
	    ...and there
	    might be more freedom in England, though her feudal lords’
	    lightest words were worth men’s lives, and though the
	    blood of the vexed husbandman dropped in the furrows of
	    her fields, than there is while the animation of her
	    multitudes is sent like fuel to feed the factory smoke,
	    and the strength of them is given daily to be wasted into
	    the fineness of a web, or racked into the exactness of a
	    line.</p>
	    	    </blockquote></section>

	    <section><blockquote>

	      <p>It is verily this degradation of the operative into a
		machine, which, more than any other evil of the times,
		is leading the mass of the nations everywhere into
		vain, incoherent, destructive struggling for a freedom
		of which they cannot explain the nature to
		themselves. Their universal outcry against wealth, and
		against nobility, is not forced from them either by
		the pressure of famine, or the sting of mortified
		pride. These do much, and have done much in all ages;
		but the foundations of society were never yet shaken
		as they are at this day.</p>
	    </blockquote></section>

	    <section><blockquote>
	    <p>
	      It is not that men are ill fed, but that they have no
	      pleasure in the work by which they make their bread, and
	      therefore look to wealth as the only means of
	      pleasure. It is not that men are pained by the scorn of
	      the upper classes, but they cannot endure their own; for
	      they feel that the kind of labor to which they are
	      condemned is verily a degrading one, and makes them less
	      than men. Never had the upper classes so much sympathy
	      with the lower, or charity for them, as they have at
	      this day, and yet never were they so much hated by
	      them:...</p>
	    </blockquote></section>

	    <section><blockquote>
	      <p>
	      for, of old, the separation between the noble and the
	      poor was merely a wall built by law; now it is a
	      veritable difference in level of standing, a precipice
	      between upper and lower grounds in the field of humanity
	      and there is pestilential air at the bottom of it.</p>

	      <section><h3>Craftsmen in the novel: Bob Hewett and Sidney Kirkwood</h3></section>
	      
	      <section><blockquote>
	    <p>Bob brought a small
	    box on to the table; it had a sliding lid, and inside were
	    certain specimens of artistic work with which he was wont
	    to amuse himself when tired of roaming the streets in
	    jovial company. Do you recollect that, when we first made
	    Bob’s acquaintance, he showed Sidney Kirkwood a medal of
	    his own design and casting? His daily work at die-sinking
	    had of course supplied him with this suggestion, and he
	      still found pleasure in work of the same kind.
	  In days
	    before commercialism had divorced art and the handicrafts,
	    a man with Bob’s distinct faculty would have found
	      encouragement to exercise it for serious ends;...
	      </p></blockquote></section>

	      <section><blockquote>
	    <p>
	  ...as it was, he remained at the semi-conscious stage with
	    regard to his own aptitudes, and cast leaden medals just
	    as a way of occupying his hands when a couple of hours
	    hung heavy on them. Partly with the thought of amusing the
	    dolorous Jack, yet more to win laudation, he brought forth
	    now a variety of casts and moulds and spread them on the
	    table. His latest piece of work was a medal in high relief
	    bearing the heads of the Prince and Princess of Wales
	    surrounded with a wreath. Bob had no political
	    convictions; with complacency he drew these royal
	    features, the sight of which would have made his father
	  foam at the mouth. (214)</p>
	      </blockquote></section>

	      <section><blockquote>
	    
	    <p>“Where’s that medal I cast last night, mother?” he
	    asked, searching in various corners of the room and
	    throwing things about...</p>
	    <p>The young man rushed forth, and in a moment
	    returned. In his hand, which was very black, and shone as
	    if from the manipulation of metals, he held a small bright
	    medal. He showed it to Sidney, saying, “What d’you think
	    o’ that?”</p>
	    <p>The work was delicate and of clever design; it
	      represented a racehorse at full speed, a jockey rising
	      in the stirrups and beating it with orthodox
	      brutality. (18–19)</p>
	      </blockquote></section>


	    <section><blockquote>
	      <p>Genuine respect for law is the result of possessing
	      something which the law exerts itself to guard. Should
	      it happen that you possess nothing, and that your
	      education in metaphysics has been grievously neglected,
	      the strong probability is, that your mind will reduce
	      the principle of society to its naked formula: Get, by
		whatever means, so long as with impunity. (217)</p>
	    </blockquote></section>

	    <section><blockquote>
	    <p>Here is a man with no moral convictions, with no conscious relations to society save those which are hostile, with no personal affections; at the same time, vaguely aware of certain faculties in himself for which life affords no scope and encouraged in various kinds of conceit by the crass stupidity of all with whom he associates. (217)</p>
	    </blockquote></section>

	    <section><blockquote>
	    <p>Years ago his father had brought him on a public
	    holiday to the Museum, and his interest was chiefly
	    excited by the collection of the Royal Seals. To that
	    quarter he first led his companion, and thence directed
	    her towards objects more likely to supply her with
	    amusement; he talked freely, and was himself surprised at
	    the show of information his memory allowed him to
	    make—desperately vague and often ludicrously wide of the
	    mark, but still a something of knowledge, retained from
	      all sorts of chance encounters by his capable mind...

	    <section><blockquote>
	    <p>...Had
	    the British Museum been open to visitors in the hours of
	    the evening, or on Sundays, Bob Hewitt would possibly have
	    been employing his leisure nowadays in more profitable
	    pursuits. Possibly; one cannot say more than that; for the
	    world to which he belonged is above all a world of
	      frustration (220)</p>

	    <section><blockquote>
	    <p>Round the walls of the parlour were hung his own
	    drawings, which used to conceal the bareness of his
	    lodging in Tysoe Street. It was three years since he had
	    touched a pencil; the last time having been when he made
	    holiday with Michael Snowdon and Jane at the farm-house by
	    Danbury Hill. The impulse would never come again. It was
	    associated with happiness, with hope; and what had his
	    life to do with one or the other? Could he have effected
	    the change without the necessity of explaining it, he
	    would gladly have put those drawings out of
	      sight. (390)</p>

	    up at him apprehensively.</p>
	    <p>“I want to stay the night over, if you’ll let me.” he

	    <p>Sidney, gazing darkly at the girl, saw her look towards him, and she smiled. The strange effect of that smile upon her features! It gave gentleness to the mouth, and, by making more manifest the intelligent light of her eyes, emphasised the singular pathos inseparable from their regard. It was a smile to which a man would concede anything, which would vanquish every prepossession, which would inspire pity and tenderness and devotion in the heart of sternest resentment.</p>

	    when her wish was gratified, she had watched each actress
	    with devouring interest, with burning envy, and had said
	    to herself, “Couldn’t I soon learn to do as well as that?
