	    <p>In the social classification of the nether world—a
	    subject which so eminently adapts itself to the sportive
	    and gracefully picturesque mode of treatment—it will be
	    convenient to distinguish broadly, and with reference to
	    males alone, the two great sections of those who do, and
	    those who do not, wear collars. Each of these orders
	    would, it is obvious, offer much scope to an analyst
	    delighting in subtle gradation. Taking the collarless, how
	    shrewdly might one discriminate between the many kinds of
	    neckcloth which our climate renders necessary as a
	      substitute for the nobler article of attire!...

	    <p>The navvy,

	    would be the varieties of texture, of fold, of knot,
	    observed in the ranks of unskilled labour. And among these
	    whose higher station is indicated by the linen or paper
	    symbol, what a gap between the mechanic with collar
	    attached to a flannel shirt, and just visible along the
	    top of a black tie, and the shopman whose pride it is to
	    adorn himself with the very ugliest neck-encloser put in
	    vogue by aristocratic sanction. For such attractive
	    disquisition I have, unfortunately, no space; it must
	      suffice that I indicate the two genera. (69)</p>

	    hour before Bob Hewett made his appearance. Greeting her

	    <p>I might have had Jane schooled and fashioned into a

	    well; but my idea went beyond <em>that</em>. There’s
	    plenty of ladies nowadays taking an interest in the
	    miserable, and spending their means unselfishly. What I
	    hoped was to raise up for the poor and the untaught a
	    friend out of their own midst, some one who had gone
	    through all that they <em>suffer</em>, who was accustomed
	    to earn her own living by the work of her hands
	    as <em>they</em> do, who had never thought herself their
	    better, who saw the world as they see it and knew all
	    their wants. A lady may do good, we know that; but she
	    can’t be the friend of the poor as I understand it;
	    there’s too great a distance between her world and
	    theirs. (178)</p>

	    <p>The frankness of Clem’s brutality went far towards
	    redeeming her character. The exquisite satisfaction with
	    which she viewed Jane’s present misery, the broad
	    joviality with which she gloated over the prospect of
	    cruelties shortly to be inflicted, put her at once on a
	    par with the noble savage running wild in
	    woods. Civilisation could bring no charge against this
	    young woman; it and she had no common criterion. Who knows
	    but this lust of hers for sanguinary domination was the
	    natural enough issue of the brutalising serfdom of her
	    predecessors in the family line of the Peckovers? A thrall
	    suddenly endowed with authority will assuredly make bitter
	    work for the luckless creature in the next degree of
