<p>There was the newly elected mayor of Middlemarch, who happened to be
a manufacturer; the philanthropic banker his brother-in-law, who
predominated so much in the town that some called him a Methodist,
others a hypocrite, according to the resources of their vocabulary; and
there were various professional men. In fact, Mrs. Cadwallader said that
Brooke was beginning to treat the Middlemarchers, and that she preferred
the farmers at the tithe-dinner, who drank her health unpretentiously,
and were not ashamed of their grandfathers’ furniture. (88)</p>

<p>It was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to discern very subtly the
faintest aroma of rank, and once when she had seen the Miss Brookes
accompanying their uncle at the county assizes, and seated among the
aristocracy, she had envied them, notwithstanding their plain dress.

	      He had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public school.  His
father, a military man, had made but little provision for three
children, and when the boy Tertius asked to have a medical education,
it seemed easier to his guardians to grant his request by apprenticing
him to a country practitioner than to make any objections on the score
of family dignity.  He was one of the rarer lads who early get a
decided bent and make up their minds that there is something particular
in life which they would like to do for its own sake, and not because

<blockquote>
<p>One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea–but why
always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard
to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our effort at
understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite
of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will know the older and
more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect. (278)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>I at least have so much to do in unraveling certain human lots, and
seeing how they were woven and interwoven, that all the light I can
command must be concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed
over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe. (141)</p>

<section>
<blockquote>
<p>Your pier-glass or extensive surface of polished steel made to be
rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and multitudinously scratched in
all directions; but place now against it a lighted candle as a centre of
illumination, and lo! the scratches will seem to arrange themselves in a
fine series of concentric circles round that little sun. It is
demonstrable that the scratches are going everywhere impartially and it
is only your candle which produces the flattering illusion of a
concentric arrangement, its light falling with an exclusive optical
selection. These things are a parable. The scratches are events, and the
candle is the egoism of any person now absent. (264)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea’s was anything very
exceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among
incongruities and left to “find their feet” among them, while their
elders go about their business. Nor can I suppose that when Mrs.
Casaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her wedding,
the situation will be regarded as tragic. Some discouragement, some
faintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary,
is not unusual, and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what
is not unusual… (194)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of frequency, has
not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of mankind; and perhaps
our frames could hardly bear much of it. If we had a keen vision and
feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass
grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which
lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk
about well wadded with stupidity. (194)</p>

    Casaubon</h2></section>
<section><h3 id="dorothea">Dorothea</h3></section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>Dorothea sank into silence on the way back to the house. She felt
some disappointment, of which she was yet ashamed, that there was
nothing for her to do in Lowick; and in the next few minutes her mind
had glanced over the possibility, which she would have preferred, of
finding that her home would be in a parish which had a larger share of
the world’s misery, so that she might have had more active duties in it.
Then, recurring to the future actually before her, she made a picture of
more complete devotion to Mr. Casaubon’s aims in which she would await
new duties. Many such might reveal themselves to the higher knowledge
gained by her in that companionship. (78)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>The duties of her married life, contemplated as so great beforehand,
seemed to be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled
landscape. The clear heights where she expected to walk in full
communion had become difficult to see even in her imagination; the
delicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken into
uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment. When would the days
begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her
husband’s life and exalt her own? Never perhaps, as she had preconceived
them; but somehow&mdash;still somehow… (274)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>In this solemnly pledged union of her life, duty would present itself
in some new form of inspiration and give a new meaning to wifely
love.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor–there was
the stifling oppression of that gentlewoman’s world, where everything
was done for her and none asked for her aid–where the sense of
connection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up
painfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims
that would have shaped her energies.… (274)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>—“What shall I do?” “Whatever you please, my dear:” that had been her
brief history since she had left off learning morning lessons and
practising silly rhythms on the hated piano. Marriage, which was to
bring guidance into worthy and imperative occupation, had not yet freed
her from the gentlewoman’s oppressive liberty: it had not even filled
her leisure with the ruminant joy of unchecked tenderness. (274)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 id="casaubon">Casaubon</h3>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>For in truth, as the day fixed for his marriage came nearer, Mr.
Casaubon did not find his spirits rising; nor did the contemplation of
that matrimonial garden scene, where, as all experience showed, the path
was to be bordered with flowers, prove persistently more enchanting to
him than the accustomed vaults where he walked taper in hand. He did not
confess to himself, still less could he have breathed to another, his
surprise that though he had won a lovely and noble-hearted girl he had
not won delight,—which he had also regarded as an object to be found by
search. … (85)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>…It is true that he knew all the classical passages implying the
contrary; but knowing classical passages, we find, is a mode of motion,
which explains why they leave so little extra force for their personal
application.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his long studious bachelorhood
had stored up for him a compound interest of enjoyment, and that large
drafts on his affections would not fail to be honored; for we all of us,
grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act fatally
on the strength of them. And now he was in danger of being saddened by
the very conviction that his circumstances were unusually happy…
(85)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>…there was nothing external by which he could account for a certain
blankness of sensibility which came over him just when his expectant
gladness should have been most lively, just when he exchanged the
accustomed dulness of his Lowick library for his visits to the Grange.
Here was a weary experience in which he was as utterly condemned to
loneliness as in the despair which sometimes threatened him while
toiling in the morass of authorship without seeming nearer to the goal.
