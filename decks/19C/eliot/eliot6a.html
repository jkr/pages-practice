	      …the inherent loneliness of the soul is surmounted; and this in turn
	      presupposes the possibility of human and interior community among men,
	      of undersanding and common action…. Such community…is achieved by
	      personalities, previously lonely and confined within their own selves,
	      adapting and accustoming themselves to one another; it is the fruit of a
	      rich and enriching resignation, the crowning of a process of education,
	      a maturity attained by struggle and effort.

	    <p>
	      We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder
	      to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from
	      that stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she
	      would devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his
	      strength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is
	      no longer reflection but feeling... that he had an
	      equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and shadows must always
	      fall with a certain difference. (211)

	    <p>Into this soul-hunger as yet all her youthful passion was poured; the
	      union which attracted her was one that would deliver her from her
	      girlish subjection to her own ignorance, and give her the freedom of
	      voluntary submission to a guide who would take her along the grandest
	      path.</p>
	    <p>“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking
	      quickly along the bridle road through the wood. “It would be my duty to
	      study that I might help him the better in his great works. There would
	      be nothing trivial about our lives. Every-day things with us would mean
	      the greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal…” (29)</p>

	    <p>Fred never became rich—his hopefulness had not led him to expect

	      furniture at Stone Court, and the work which Mr. Garth put into his
	      hands carried him in plenty through those “bad times” which are always
	      present with farmers. (834)</p>

	    <p>He had gained an excellent practice, alternating, according to the
	      season, between London and a Continental bathing-place; having written a
	      treatise on Gout, a disease which has a good deal of wealth on its side.
	      His skill was relied on by many paying patients, but he always regarded
	      himself as a failure: he had not done what he once meant to do.

	    <p>Some one highly susceptible to the contemplation of a fine act has
	      said, that it produces a sort of regenerating shudder through the frame,
	      and makes one feel ready to begin a new life. A good degree of that
	      effect was just then present in Fred Vincy. (676)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>When Fred was riding home on winter evenings he had a pleasant vision
	      beforehand of the bright hearth in the wainscoated parlour, and was
	      sorry for other men who could not have Mary for their wife; especially
	      for Mr. Farebrother. (834)</p>

	    <p>she walked round and round the brown library considering by what sort
	      of manoeuvre she could arrest her wandering thoughts. Perhaps a mere
	      task was the best means—something to which she must go doggedly. Was
	      there not the geography of Asia Minor, in which her slackness had often
	      been rebuked by Mr. Casaubon? (806)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>But for her visitors Dorothea too might have been shut up in the
	      library, and would not have witnessed this scene of old Featherstone’s
	      funeral, which, aloof as it seemed to be from the tenor of her life,
	      always afterwards came back to her at the touch of certain sensitive
	      points in memory, just as the vision of St. Peter’s at Rome was inwoven
	      with moods of despondency. Scenes which make vital changes in our
	      neighbors’ lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a particular
	      aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for us with the
	      epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity which lies in
	      the selection of our keenest consciousness. (326)</p>

	    <p>He knew that this was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous
	      even with his habitual foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he
	      was resolved to do. He had two selves within him apparently, and they
	      must learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments.
	      Strange, that some of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our
	      infatuations, and even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide
	      plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us. (152)</p>

	    <p>He had more reason than ever for trusting his judgment, now that it

	      view of woman, entertaining no expectations, but such as were justified
	      beforehand. (153)</p>

	    <p>Then came the moment of transition; it was with the sense of
	      promotion he had when he, an orphan educated at a commercial
	      charity-school, was invited to a fine villa belonging to Mr. Dunkirk,
	      the richest man in the congregation. Soon he became an intimate there,
	      honored for his piety by the wife, marked out for his ability by the

	    <p>While he was speaking there came a vivid flash of lightning which lit
	      each of them up for the other–and the light seemed to be the terror of a
	      hopeless love. Dorothea darted instantaneously from the window; Will
	      followed her, seizing her hand with a spasmodic movement; and so they
	      stood, with their hands clasped, like two children, looking out on the
	      storm, while the thunder gave a tremendous crack and roll above them,
	      and the rain began to pour down. (810)</p>

	    <p>Dorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other women,
	      feeling that there was always something better which she might have
	      done, if she had only been better and known better. Still, she never
	      repented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will
	      Ladislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as sorrow
	      to him if she had repented. They were bound to each other by a love
	      stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life would
	      have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion, and
	      she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she had
	      not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for
	      herself...</p></blockquote></section>
	
	<section><blockquote><p>Will
	      became an ardent public man, working well in those times when reforms
	      were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has been
	      much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to Parliament by
	      a constituency who paid his expenses. Dorothea could have liked nothing
	      better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband should be in the
	      thick of a struggle against them, and that she should give him wifely
	      help. Many who knew her, thought it a pity that so substantive and rare
	      a creature should have been absorbed into the life of another, and be
	      only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother. (835–6)</p>

	    <p>They were the mixed result of a young and noble impulse struggling
	      amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great
	      feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect
	      of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong
	      that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it. A new Theresa
	      will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventual life, any
	      more than a new Antigone will spend her heroic piety in daring all for
	      the sake of a brother’s burial: the medium in which their ardent deeds
	      took shape is forever gone. (838)</p>

	    <p>They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling
	      under prosaic conditions. Among the many remarks passed on her mistakes,
	      it was never said in the neighbourhood of Middlemarch that such mistakes
	      could not have happened if the society into which she was born had not
	      smiled on propositions of marriage from a sickly man to a girl less than
	      half his own age…. While this is the social air which mortals begin to
	      breathe, there will be collisions such as those in Dorothea’s life,
	      where great feelings…(n852)</p>

	    <p>Her finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were
	      not widely visible. Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus
	      broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on
	      the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was
	      incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly
	      dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you
	      and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived
	      faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.</p>
