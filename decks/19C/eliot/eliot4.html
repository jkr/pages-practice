The railroad is in all its relations a matter of earnest business, to be
got through as soon as possible. It transmutes a man from a traveller
into a living parcel. For the time he has parted with the nobler
characteristics of his humanity for the sake of the planetary power of
locomotion. Do not ask him to admire anything. You might as well ask the
wind.

	<section><h3>Dorothea and Casaubon</h3></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Dorothea sank into silence on the way back to the
          house. She felt some disappointment, of which she was yet
          ashamed, that there was nothing for her to do in Lowick;
          and in the next few minutes her mind had glanced over the
          possibility, which she would have preferred, of finding
          that her home would be in a parish which had a larger
          share of the world’s misery, so that she might have had
          more active duties in it. Then, recurring to the future
          actually before her, she made a picture of more complete
          devotion to Mr. Casaubon’s aims in which she would await
          new duties. Many such might reveal themselves to the
          higher knowledge gained by her in that companionship.
          (78)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p style="font-size:95%;">The duties of her married life, contemplated as so
          great beforehand, seemed to be shrinking with the
          furniture and the white vapor-walled landscape. The clear
          heights where she expected to walk in full communion had
          become difficult to see even in her imagination; the
          delicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had
          been shaken into uneasy effort and alarmed with dim
          presentiment. When would the days begin of that active
          wifely devotion which was to strengthen her husband’s
          life and exalt her own? Never perhaps, as she had
          preconceived them; but somehow&mdash;still somehow. In this
          solemnly pledged union of her life, duty would present
          itself in some new form of inspiration and give a new
          meaning to wifely love. &hellip; (274)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	  
	<section><blockquote>
          <p  style="font-size:92%;">Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun
          vapor–there was the stifling oppression of that
          gentlewoman’s world, where everything was done for her
          and none asked for her aid–where the sense of connection
          with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up
          painfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from
          without in claims that would have shaped her
          energies.—“What shall I do?” “Whatever you please, my
          dear:” that had been her brief history since she had left
          off learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms
          on the hated piano. Marriage, which was to bring guidance
          into worthy and imperative occupation, had not yet freed
          her from the gentlewoman’s oppressive liberty: it had not
          even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of
            unchecked tenderness. (274)</p>
	</blockquote></section>


	<section><blockquote>
          <p style="font-size:92%;">For in truth, as the day fixed for his marriage came
          nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not find his spirits rising; nor
          did the contemplation of that matrimonial garden scene,
          where, as all experience showed, the path was to be
          bordered with flowers, prove persistently more enchanting
          to him than the accustomed vaults where he walked taper
          in hand. He did not confess to himself, still less could
          he have breathed to another, his surprise that though he
          had won a lovely and noble-hearted girl he had not won
          delight,–which he had also regarded as an object to be
          found by search. It is true that he knew all the
          classical passages implying the contrary; but knowing
          classical passages, we find, is a mode of motion, which
          explains why they leave so little extra force for their
          personal application.&hellip; (85)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	  
	<section><blockquote>
          <p style="font-size:97%;">&hellip; Poor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his long studious
          bachelorhood had stored up for him a compound interest of
          enjoyment, and that large drafts on his affections would
          not fail to be honored; for we all of us, grave or light,
          get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act fatally
          on the strength of them. And now he was in danger of
          being saddened by the very conviction that his
          circumstances were unusually happy: there was nothing
          external by which he could account for a certain
          blankness of sensibility which came over him just when
          his expectant gladness should have been most lively, just
          when he exchanged the accustomed dulness of his Lowick
          library for his visits to the Grange.&hellip; (85)

	<section><blockquote>
        <p>&hellip; Here was a weary
          experience in which he was as utterly condemned to
          loneliness as in the despair which sometimes threatened
          him while toiling in the morass of authorship without
          seeming nearer to the goal. (85)</p>

	<section><h3>Tertius and Rosamond</h3></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p style="font-size:92%;">Yet this result, which she took to be a mutual
          impression, called falling in love, was just what
          Rosamond had contemplated beforehand. Ever since that
          important new arrival in Middlemarch she had woven a
          little future, of which something like this scene was the
          necessary beginning. Strangers, whether wrecked and
          clinging to a raft, or duly escorted and accompanied by
          portmanteaus, have always had a circumstantial
          fascination for the virgin mind, against which native
          merit has urged itself in vain. And a stranger was
          absolutely necessary to Rosamond’s social romance, which
          had always turned on a lover and bridegroom who was not a
          Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at all like her
          own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand
          that he should somehow be related to a baronet.
          (117–18)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p style="font-size:91%;">Poor Lydgate! or shall I say, Poor Rosamond! Each
          lived in a world of which the other knew nothing. It had
          not occurred to Lydgate that he had been a subject of
          eager meditation to Rosamond, who had neither any reason
          for throwing her marriage into distant perspective, nor
          any pathological studies to divert her mind from that
          ruminating habit, that inward repetition of looks, words,
          and phrases, which makes a large part in the lives of
          most girls.…In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to
          imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his
          serious business in the world: of course, he had a
          profession and was clever, as well as sufficiently
          handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate was his good
          birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch
          admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising
          in rank&hellip; (165–66)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	<section><blockquote>
          <p>Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly
          with Tertius Lydgate as he was in himself, but with his
          relation to her. (166)</p>

          were. I have already refused him. If I loved, I should
          love at once and without change," said Rosamond, with a
          great sense of being a romantic heroine, and playing the
          part prettily. (297)</p>

“That is like saying you wish you had married another man.”</p>

profession, dear.” We know that she had much quiet perseverance in her
opinion.</p>
<p>“It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond,” said Lydgate,
gravely. “And to say that you love me without loving the medical man in
me, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach but
don’t like its flavor. Don’t say that again, dear, it pains me.”
