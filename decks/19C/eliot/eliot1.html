	    <p><span>[</span>From <em>Adam Bede</em><span>]</span></p>
	    <p>…if I were a clever novelist, not obliged to creep servilely after
	      nature and fact, but able to represent things as they never have been
	      and never will be…<span>[</span>then<span>]</span> my characters would
	      be entirely of my own choosing, and I could select the most
	      unexceptionable type of clergyman, and put my own admirable opinions
	      into his mouth on all occasions. But you must have perceived long ago
	      that I have no such lofty vocation, and that I aspire to give no more
	      than a faithful account of men and things as they have mirrored
	      themselves in my mind. …</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>… It is so very rarely that facts hit that nice medium required by
	      our own enlightened opinions and refined taste! Perhaps you will say,
	      “Do improve the facts a little, then; make them more accordant with
	      those correct views which it is our privilege to possess…”</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>...But, my good friend, what will you do then with your
	      fellow-parishioner who opposes your husband in the vestry? With your
	      newly appointed vicar, whose style of preaching you find painfully below
	      that of his regretted predecessor? With the honest servant who worries
	      your soul with her one failing? With your neighbour, Mrs. Green, who was
	      really kind to you in your last illness, but has said several
	      ill-natured things about you since your convalescence? Nay, with your
	      excellent husband himself, who has other irritating habits besides that
	      of not wiping his shoes?</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>These fellow-mortals, every one, must be accepted as they are: you
	      can neither straighten their noses, nor brighten their wit, nor rectify
	      their dispositions; and it is these people—amongst whom your life is
	      passed—that it is needful you should tolerate, pity, and love: it is
	      these more or less ugly, stupid, inconsistent people whose movements of
	      goodness you should be able to admire—for whom you should cherish all
	      possible hopes, all possible patience.</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>And I would not, even if I had the choice, be the clever novelist who
	      could create a world so much better than this, in which we get up in the
	      morning to do our daily work, that you would be likely to turn a harder,
	      colder eye on the dusty streets and the common green fields—on the real
	      breathing men and women, who can be chilled by your indifference or
	      injured by your prejudice; who can be cheered and helped onward by your
	      fellow-feeling, your forbearance, your outspoken, brave justice.

		aesthetic rules which shall banish from the region of Art those old
		women scraping carrots with their work-worn hands, those heavy clowns
		taking holiday in a dingy pot-house, those rounded backs and stupid
		weather-beaten faces that have bent over the spade and done the rough
		work of the world–those homes with their tin pans, their brown pitchers,
		their rough curs, and their clusters of onions. In this world there are
		so many of these common coarse people, who have no picturesque
		sentimental wretchedness! It is so needful we should remember their
		existence, else we may happen to leave them quite out of our religion
		and philosophy and frame lofty theories which only fit a world of
		extremes. (<em>Adam Bede</em>, 178)</span></p>

	    <p>I should like to make life beautiful—I mean everybody’s life. And

	      enjoyment of anything when I am made to think that most people are shut
	      out from it. (219)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
	    <p><span style="font-size:85%;"> That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was
		certainly not the last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born who
		found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding
		of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring
		of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of
		opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and
		sank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance they
		tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but after all,
		to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and
		formlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent
		social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge for
		the ardently willing soul. (3)</span></p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the
	      inconvenient indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned
	      the natures of women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence
	      as strict as the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of
	      women might be treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the
	      indefiniteness remains…. Here and there is born a Saint Theresa,
	      foundress of nothing, whose loving heart-beats and sobs after an
	      unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed among hindrances,
	      instead of centring in some long-recognizable deed. (3)</p>

	    <p><span style="font-size:90%;"> It had now entered Dorothea’s mind that Mr. Casaubon might
		wish to make her his wife, and the idea that he would do so touched her
		with a sort of reverential gratitude. How good of him—nay, it would be
		almost as if a winged messenger had suddenly stood beside her path and
		held out his hand towards her! For a long while she had been oppressed
		by the <strong>indefiniteness</strong> which hung in her mind, like a
		thick summer haze, over all her desire to make her life greatly
		effective. What could she do, what ought she to do?—she, hardly more
		than a budding woman, but yet with an active conscience and a great
		mental need, not to be satisfied by a girlish instruction comparable to
		the nibblings and judgments of a discursive mouse… (28-29)</span></p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>Into this soul-hunger as yet all her youthful passion was poured; the
	      union which attracted her was one that would deliver her from her
	      girlish subjection to her own ignorance, and give her the freedom of
	      voluntary submission to a guide who would take her along the grandest
	      path.</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking
	      quickly along the bridle road through the wood. “There would be nothing
	      trivial about our lives. Every-day things with us would mean the
	      greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal. I should learn to see
	      the truth by the same light as great men have seen it by. And then I
	      should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it was
	      possible to lead a grand life here—now—in England. I don’t feel sure
	      about doing good in any way now: everything seems like going on a
	      mission to a people whose language I don’t know…” (28–29)</p>
