	      It sets a limit, we think, to the development of the old-fashioned
English novel. Its diffuseness, on which we have touched, makes it too
copious a dose of pure fiction. If we write novels so, how shall we
write History?

	<section><h3>First Reform Act (1832)</h3></section>

<section><blockquote>
<p>1. Realigned the representation in the house of commons. Shifted
representation toward the cities, and decreased “rotten boroughs.”
Formalized the shift in power from rural landowning nobility and gentry
to the urban middle class.</p>
<p class="fragment">2. Extended the franchise, increased the electorate by 50-80%. (Now
653,000 adult males could vote). Instead of owning land, it was enough
to be paying a certain amount of rent.</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>All people, young or old (that is, all people in those ante-reform
times)... (27)</p>
<p>For in that part of the country, before reform had done its notable
part in developing the political consciousness, there was a clearer
distinction of ranks and a dimmer distinction of parties... (88)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>Certainly nothing at present could seem much less important to
Lydgate than the turn of Miss Brooke’s mind, or to Miss Brooke than the
qualities of the woman who had attracted this young surgeon. But any one
watching keenly the stealthy convergence of human lots, sees a slow
preparation of effects from one life on another, which tells like a
calculated irony on the indifference or the frozen stare with which we
look at our unintroduced neighbor. Destiny stands by sarcastic with our
dramatis personae folded in her hand… (95)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>Old provincial society had its share of this subtle movement: had not
only its striking downfalls, its brilliant young professional dandies
who ended by living up an entry with a drab and six children for their
establishment but also those less marked vicissitudes which are
constantly shifting the boundaries of social intercourse, and begetting
new consciousness of interdependence. Some slipped a little downward,
some got higher footing: people denied aspirates, gained wealth, and
fastidious gentlemen stood for boroughs; some were caught in political
currents, some in ecclesiastical, and perhaps found themselves
surprisingly grouped in consequence; … (95)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>…while a few personages or families that stood with rocky firmness
amid all this fluctuation, were slowly presenting new aspects in spite
of solidity, and altering with the double change of self and beholder.
Municipal town and rural parish gradually made fresh threads of
connection&mdash;gradually, as the old stocking gave way to the savings-bank
and the worship of the solar guinea became extinct; while squires and
baronets, and even lords who had once lived blamelessly afar from the
civic mind, gathered the faultiness of closer acquaintanceship. (95)</p>
</blockquote></section>

<section><blockquote>We belated historians must not linger after his example;
and if we did so, it is probable that our chat would be thin and eager, as if
delivered from a campstool in a parrot-house. I at least have so much to do in
unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven and interwoven,
that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web,
and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe.

<section><blockquote>
<p>these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent
		social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge for
		the ardently willing soul...</p>

	    <p> Here and there is born a Saint Theresa,
	      foundress of nothing, whose loving heart-beats and sobs after an
	      unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed among hindrances,
	      instead of centring in some long-recognizable deed. (3)</p>

	    <p>“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking
	      quickly along the bridle road through the wood. “There would be nothing
	      trivial about our lives. Every-day things with us would mean the
	      greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal. I should learn to see
	      the truth by the same light as great men have seen it by. And then I
	      should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it was
	      possible to lead a grand life here&mdash;now&mdash;in England. I don’t feel sure
	      about doing good in any way now: everything seems like going on a
	      mission to a people whose language I don’t know…” (28–29)</p>

<p>She threw off her mantle and bonnet, and sat down opposite to him, enjoying
the glow, but lifting up her beautiful hands for a screen. They were not thin
hands, or small hands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands. She seemed to be
holding them up in propitiation for her passionate desire to know and to think,
which in the <span class="fragment highlight-current-green"

issued in crying and red eyelids. (38)</p>

<p>Other people would say…that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for
the sake of making himself important and getting on in the world. What
then? He for his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had
been concerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s
friendship or enmity. What he really cared for was a <span class="fragment

<p>The affair of the chaplaincy remained a sore point in his memory as a
case in which <span class="fragment
              highlight-current-green" data-fragment-index="2">this petty medium of Middlemarch</span> had been too strong for

<p>“Oh, you are a wise man, are you not? You know all about life and
death. Advise me. Think what I can do. He has been laboring all his life
and looking forward. He minds about nothing else.—And I mind about
nothing else—”</p>
<p>For years after Lydgate remembered the impression produced in him by
this involuntary appeal&mdash;this cry from soul to soul, without other
consciousness than their moving with kindred natures in <span class="fragment

<section><h3>Life under a Microscope</h3></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p>…a telescope might have swept the parishes of Tipton and Freshitt,
the whole area visited by Mrs. Cadwallader in her phaeton, without
witnessing any interview that could excite suspicion, or any scene from
which she did not return with the same unperturbed keenness of eye and
the same high natural color. In fact, if that convenient vehicle had
existed in the days of the Seven Sages, one of them would doubtless have
remarked, that you can know little of women by following them about in
their pony-phaetons. Even with a microscope directed on a water-drop we
find ourselves making interpretations which turn out to be rather
coarse; … (59-60)</p>

<p>… for whereas under a weak lens you may seem to see a creature
exhibiting an active voracity into which other smaller creatures
actively play as if they were so many animated tax-pennies, a stronger
lens reveals to you certain tiniest hairlets which make vortices for
these victims while the swallower waits passively at his receipt of
custom. In this way, metaphorically speaking, a strong lens applied to
Mrs. Cadwallader’s match-making will show a play of minute causes
producing what may be called thought and speech vortices to bring her
the sort of food she needed. (59–60)</p>

tissues…(149)</p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea&mdash;but why
always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard
to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our effort at
understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite
of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will know the older and
more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect. (278)</p>
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:90%;"> Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea’s
was anything very exceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out
among incongruities and left to "find their feet" among them, while their elders
go about their business. Nor can I suppose that when Mrs. Casaubon is discovered
in a fit of weeping six weeks after her wedding, the situation will be regarded
as tragic. Some discouragement, some faintness of heart at the new real future
which replaces the imaginary, is not unusual, and we do not expect people to be
deeply moved by what is not unusual. That element of tragedy which lies in the
very fact of frequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of
mankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it.… (194)</span></p>

<section><blockquote>
<p>If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it
would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and
we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As
it is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.
