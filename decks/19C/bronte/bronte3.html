	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>Mrs. Rochester! She did not exist: she would not be born till
	      to-morrow, some time after eight o’clock a.m.; and I would wait to be
	      assured she had come into the world alive before I assigned to her all
	      that property. It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my
	      dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black
	      stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit
	      of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent
	      from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange,
	      wraith-like apparel it contained. (275)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>“I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling
	      there. I asked, ‘Sophie, what are you doing?’ No one answered; but a
	      form emerged from the closet…” (283)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike
	      my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. “Jane!”
	      called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the
	      stairs by Mr. Rochester. (286)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up, gazed
	      at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the
	      mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features
	      quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass. (283)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the
	      gallery towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made
	      to shut in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
	      (147)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I
	      could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
	      pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
	      the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
	      solitude of the spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever
	      bright visions rose before it. (109)</p>

	    <p>“Where the dickens is she!” he continued. “Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to
	      his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the
	      rain&mdash;bad animal!” (9)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran
	      backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one
	      could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours;
	      it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
	      covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
	      mane, hid its head and face. (293)</p>

	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>“Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!” (11)</p>
	    <p>And this man I bent over&mdash;this commonplace, quiet stranger&mdash;how had he
	      become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
	      (210)</p>
	</blockquote></section>
	<section><blockquote>
	    <p>Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as
	      men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their
	      efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a
	      restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and
	      it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say
	      that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting
	      stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is
	      thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more
	      or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex. …

	    <p>… When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh: the
	      same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had
	      thrilled me. (110)</p>

	      fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!”</p>

	    <p>I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and before that time she
	      had tried me indeed: her character ripened and developed with frightful
	      rapidity; her vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only
	      cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty. What a pigmy
	      intellect she had, and what giant propensities! (306)</p>
	</blockquote></section>

	  <blockquote>
<p>The phrases “animal passions,” “lower propensities,” “brutal lusts,”
etc., have been so frequently applied to the perversions of amativeness
that many persons, perhaps the majority, have acquired the habit of
associating the idea of vulgarity and indecency with sexual intercourse.

<p>But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this
filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may
be, though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her
countenance: Pilot is more like me than she. Some years after I had
broken with the mother, she abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy
with a musician or singer. I acknowledged no natural claim on Adele’s
part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not
her father…</p>
