    Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,<br/>
Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm,<br/>
Fill up the intersperséd vacancies<br/>
And momentary pauses of the thought!<br/>
My babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart<br/>
With tender gladness, thus to look at thee,<br/>
And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,<br/>
And in far other scenes! For I was reared<br/>
In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim,<br/>
And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars.<br/>
But thou, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze<br/>
By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags<br/>
Of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds,<br/>

Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores<br/>
And mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear<br/>
The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible<br/>
Of that eternal language, which thy God<br/>

Himself in all, and all things in himself.<br/>
Great universal Teacher! he shall mould<br/>
    Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask.

The Youth, who daily farther from the east<br/>

	    <p> Why do you like Miss Austen so much? I am puzzled on that point…
	      I got the book and studied it. And what did I find? An accurate
	      daguerreotyped portrait of a common-place face; a carefully
	      fenced, highly cultivated garden with neat borders and delicate
	      flowers–but no glance of a bright, vivid physiognomy&mdash;no open
	      country&mdash;no fresh air&mdash;no blue hill&mdash;no bonny beck.
	      I should hardly like to live with her ladies and gentlemen in
	      their elegant but confined houses. (Brontë, letter, 1850)

		  I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden
    a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared
    would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done, I
    lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the
    dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the
    still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the
    morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was
    noting these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it

	    <p> Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right

  separating me from the drear November day.  At intervals, while
  turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that
  winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud;
  near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain
  sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast. (8)

  scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I abandoned it and

children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
for me was synonymous with degradation.
