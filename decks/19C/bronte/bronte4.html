	      It should not be possible to read nineteenth-century British
	      literature without remembering that imperialism, understood as
	      England's social mission, was a crucial part of the cultural
	      representation of England to the English. The role of literature
	      in the production of cultural representation should not be
	      ignored.

	</section>

<section>
<blockquote>
<p>Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the
sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the
world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment
I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the
coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must
remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute. (322)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
ornaments on the mantelpi ece, such prints, including a portrait of
George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a
representation of the death of Wolfe... (93)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from
the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my
cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am
warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours’
exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four o’clock
a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight... (93)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very
tranquil in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would
be some one to meet me...</p>
<p>It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted. (93)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely
for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely
blest&mdash;blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband’s
life as fully as he is mine. (450)</p>
<p>St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. (452)</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>
<p>Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment—not a charm or
hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are—none that saw me would have
a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no relative but the
universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and ask repose.
(322–23)</p>

<section>
<blockquote>
<p>My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.
It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.
It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
attempts to seek him. (324)</p>

<p>A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and
dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and

improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste
that encumber it. (452)</p>

<p>This, which may be termed the government of leading-strings, seems to
be the one required to carry such a people the most rapidly through the
next necessary step in social progress... I need scarcely remark that
leading-strings are only admissible as a means of gradually training the
people to walk alone. (J. S. Mill, <em>Representative Government</em>,
(1861))</p>

	    The heart bleeds to think of the scenes of human suffering and wretchedness they commemorate,&mdash;the bloodshed and the wrongs,&mdash;all man's violence and cruelty, and woman's
faithfulness! Let us hope that a new day has dawned on India, and that these wretched
sacrifices may be spoken of by future generations as things that were, before British dominion
enlightened India, and may the beneficent rule of the young Island Queen of the West be
made memorable in her eastern dominions by those blessings of moral, and political, and
physical improvement, which, once established, may go on conquering and to conquer, until
every dark recess of the Cavern of Error shall have been enlightened, and every stronghold
of cruelty and superstition been overthrown! (“The Suttee: The Narrative of an
	    Eye-Witness,” 1843)

<p>I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet
on your forehead,&mdash;which it will become: for nature, at least, has
stamped her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the
bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with
rings. (259)</p>

little English girl for the Grand Turk’s whole seraglio, gazelle- eyes,

to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive
slave- purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
satisfactorily here.” (269)</p>

<p>I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a
prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:

half desperate, “grant me at least a new servitude!”</p>

<p>I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
<em>out</em> of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a
moment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties,
and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to
go all lengths. (ch. 2)</p>

<section>
<blockquote>
<p>I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not
the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or
God assign? Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one
best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and
demolished hopes? I believe I must say, Yes&mdash;and yet I shudder. Alas! If
I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to
premature death. (404)</p>

<p>I felt veneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus
thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to
cease struggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the
gulf of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset
by him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I
was a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.</p>
