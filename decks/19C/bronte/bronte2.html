	    <p>“No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
	      others don’t love me I would rather die than live&mdash;I cannot bear to be
	      solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from
	      you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
	      submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or

	      thought to her well-remembered tones&mdash;still picturing her pale and
	      spiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her
	      placid deathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine

	      principle of light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to
	      inspire the creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be
	      communicated to some being higher than man&mdash;perhaps to pass through

	      equal in birth, manners, and education, but our inferior in worldly
	      wealth. Take a lady, in every meaning of the word, born and bred, and
	      let her father pass through the gazette, and she wants nothing more to

	    <p>… We need the imprudencies, extravagancies, mistakes, or crimes of a
	      certain number of fathers, to sow that seed from which we reap the
	      harvest of governesses. There is no other class of labourers for hire
	      who are thus systematically supplied by the misfortunes of our
	      fellow-creatures. There is no other class which so cruelly requires its
	      members to be, in birth, mind, and manners, above their station, in
	      order to fit them for their station. (1848 Review of <em>JE</em>)</p>

	    <p>But what teachers do you give your girls, and what reverence do you

	      conduct, or her own intellect, of much importance, when you trust the
	      entire formation of her character, moral and intellectual, to a person
	      whom you let your servants treat with less respect than they do your
	      housekeeper (as if the soul of your child were a less charge than jams
	      and groceries), and whom you yourself think you confer an honor upon by
