	      Sir William Lucas had been
	      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a
	      tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood
	      by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The
	      distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had
	      given him a disgust to his business, and to his
	      residence in a small market town and, in
	      quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a

	      ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were
	      therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
	      themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a
	      respectable family in the north of England; a
