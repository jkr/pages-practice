	      She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither
	      Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she
	      had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      “How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have
	      prided myself on my discernment!… Had I been in love, I
	      could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity,
	      not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference
	      of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the
	      very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
	      prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away,
	      where either were concerned. Till this moment I never

	      In the gallery there were many family portraits, but
	      they could have little to fix the attention of a
	      stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face
	      whose features would be known to her. At last it
	      arrested her&mdash;and she beheld a striking resemblance to
	      Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she
	      remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at
	      her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in
	      earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before
	      they quitted the gallery. (189)

	      There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind,

	      had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The
	      commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no
	      trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the
	      praise of an intelligent servant?&hellip; Every idea
	      that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was
	      favourable to his character, and as she stood before the
	      canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
	      upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper
	      sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before;
