	[&ldquo;Experience&rdquo;] no longer designates something that is

	      It now refers to an acquisitive tendency. It implies growth, the

	      Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour,
	      hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk
	      after her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but
	      just <em>affect</em> concern in missing him; she really
